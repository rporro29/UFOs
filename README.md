# UFOs Javascript challenge,

## Overview of the analysis
For this week's challenge, we were tasked to update the UFO sighting search website by adding a city, state, country, and shape filters.
These updates will allow the user to use the site more precisely by filtering exactly what they are looking for.

## Results
Once the user reaches the website, they will see an unfiltered table containing some of the data. See the picture below.

The user must fill out the filter search boxes on the left side of the website. I will be using NC as an example. In the picture below, you will see that only the UFO sightings in the state of NC  will be visible.

## Summary:

One drawback of the webpage is that it only has sightings in the USA right now. 
Two things that I recommend. The first is to add International UFO sightings to the website. Second is a form of user-added UFO sightings. A user could add a sighting with pictures or video. We would need other users from that area to confirm that it was an actual sighting to prevent fake sightings from being posted.
